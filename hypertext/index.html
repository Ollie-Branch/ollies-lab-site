            New website layout in progress!!! Moving away from Hugo and
            onto plain HTML and CSS to make re-styling easier hopefully.

            I'm Ollie Branch, mischievous changeling of the wired
            who finally got around to creating their own website to try the
            indie web. Most of what you'll find around here is me documenting my
            experiments in life, with all the technical and creative pursuits
            that exist within. If we don't become bitter arch nemeses, I hope we
            can at least be friends. If we do become arch nemeses, however, I
            hope you can be the Perry to my Dr. Doofenshmirtz <br>

            This site started out as a technical blog made with hugo but I've
            decided to rewrite it using the bare essentials of HTML, CSS, and JS
            (with a little help from HTMX and Go on the backend). As I've become
            more aware of the indie web, and dedicated a little time to
            exploring it, I've realized how important creating your own website
            can be as the web becomes more centralized into silos. It's not only
            great as a fallback in case you lose those centralized platforms
            somehow, but also because you can express yourself in ways that are
            truly impossible on the big platforms.

            With great power comes great responsibility, and being evil is hard
            work. Great effort goes into creating the typographical and design
            crimes you see here

            Whether you are here to stay, or passing through on your way to
            parts unknown, I hope your time here treats you well. Any time is a
            great time to view and enjoy hand-crafted websites. <br>

            Simply download this button:
            <br>
            <img src="/assets/ollies-lab-animated.gif">
            <br>
            and attach it to your site using:
            <br>
            <code>&lt;a href=&quot;www.olliebranch.xyz&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ollies-lab-animated.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>
            <br>
            <br>
            While I don't recommend it, you can also link directly to the image
            itself using the url:
            <br>
            <code>www.olliebranch.xyz/assets/ollies-lab-animated.gif</code>
            <br>
            <br>
            This has the benefit being up-to-date (if I ever update the
            button your site will reflect that change) but at the same time
            there's a risk of the image link becoming dead.

                    something gets busted in the process of server side

                    Make the backend more scalable, I'm thinking a rudimentary setup
                    would be a tsv file on the backend that defines all the
                    endpoints and metadata the server needs for SSR. Maybe
                    re-scanning the file every once in a while to repopulate it
                    so I don't have to rebuild or re-run the backend every time.
                    <br> <br>
                    Maybe I could make something that automagically populates
                    the tsv based on metadata in the html documents themselves?
                    Attach it to a script that traverses the directory tree and
                    reads headers perhaps. This would make updates easier if the
                    directory tree changes and prevent dead links from
                    accumulating.

                    Move away from missing.css and onto my own stylesheets, this is
                    a placeholder solution to buy me time to work on the backend and
                    content a little bit.
