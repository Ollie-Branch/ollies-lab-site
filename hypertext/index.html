            New website layout in progress!!! Moving away from Hugo and
            onto plain HTML and CSS to make modifying easier hopefully.

            I'm Ollie Branch, mischievous changeling of the wired
            who finally got around to creating their own website to try the
            indie web. Most of what you'll find around here is me documenting my
            experiments in life, with all the technical and creative pursuits
            that exist within. If we don't become bitter arch nemeses, I hope we
            can at least be friends. If we do become arch nemeses, however, I
            hope you can be the Perry to my Dr. Doofenshmirtz <br>

            This site started out as a technical blog made with hugo but I've
            decided to rewrite it using the bare essentials of HTML, CSS, and JS
            (with a little help of HTMX and Go on the backend). As I've become
            more aware of the indie web, and dedicated a little time to
            exploring it, I've realized how important creating your own website
            can be as the web becomes more centralized into silos. It's not only
            great as a fallback in case you lose those centralized platforms
            somehow, but also because you can express yourself in ways that are
            truly impossible on the big platforms.

            With great power comes great responsibility, and being evil is hard
            work. Great effort goes into creating the typographical and design
            crimes you see here

            Whether you are here to stay, or passing through on your way to
            parts unknown, I hope your time here treats you well. Any time is a
            great time to view and enjoy hand-crafted websites. <br>

            Move away from missing.css and onto my own stylesheets, this is
            a placeholder solution to buy me time to work on the backend and
            content a little bit.
