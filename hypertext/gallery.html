            This is a gallery of drawings and screenshots from my favorite games.
            I'm not really an artist but I do enjoy drawing from time to time
            and I love photography whenever I find myself incidentally taking
            photos (I almost never do photography intentionally oddly enough,
            usually I start because someone wants me to take a picture or
            something catches my eye once and next thing I know the next few
            hours disappear).

            This place is under construction, come back later when there's more
            content to show.
