            This is a place for abandoned projects, gone but not forgotten. I
            only put projects in here that are for sure cancelled because
            whatever purpose I could have gotten from them has long since been
            fulfilled.
        </p>

            Sometimes, it is important to realize that a project no longer
            serves you or your goals as things change, or that whatever you
            needed a project for has been fulfilled.

            It's not impossible for a piece in the museum to be picked back up,
            but it's unlikely. These are the projects that are abandoned for
            good reason.

            This place is under construction, come back later when there's more
            content to show.
